# structuredNotepad
This is an improvement of the B-Pad application I developed earlier on. Hopefully it ends up being better organized in terms of code because it's ancestor was a complete mess.

##Changelog 
-Many codefixes and code generally looks prettier
-new Tablet view adaptations.
-Working Fingerprint unlock for Android 6.0+ (No other locked note unlock method available)
-Initial upload.
